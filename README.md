# Analyzing Canada-US Trade ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦-ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

### Business Task 
Should the Canadian government move forward with retaliatory tariffs?

### Learnings
Delivered scenario-based recommendations on tariff retaliation, balancing short-term protectionism with long-term supply strategy.

### Data Set
- Government of Canada trade data, specifically the top 25 industries in trade (USD) from 2002 to 2024 from [Government of Canada](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/app/ixb/tdo/crtr.html?&productType=NAICS&lang=eng)
- Canadian GDP from [WorldBank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?end=2023&locations=CA&start=2000&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Tools
- Built and cleaned large CSV datasets in Excel, utilizing VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP

### Recommendations
- Oil and gas is Canadaâ€™s top industry for trade surpluses; steel and aluminum are not in the top 5 for trade surpluses.
- Tariffs on steel and aluminum may be ineffective, as seen in the 2018-2019 Tariff War.
- Targeted tariffs on select oil and gas exports could have a greater impact than a blanket tariff.
- Current Trade friction between Canada and the US is an opportunity to forge new trade partnerships.
